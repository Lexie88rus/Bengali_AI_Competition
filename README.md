1. [Bengali Handwritten Character Classification using Transfer Learning on Deep Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/html/1902.11133), [repo](https://github.com/swagato-c/bangla-hwcr-present): In this paper, we propose a solution which uses state-of-the-art techniques in Deep Learning to tackle the problem of Bengali Handwritten Character Recognition ( HCR ). Our method uses lesser iterations to train than most other comparable methods. We employ Transfer Learning on ResNet 50, a state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network Model, pretrained on ImageNet dataset. We also use other techniques like a modified version of One Cycle Policy, varying the input image sizes etc. to ensure that our training occurs fast. We use the BanglaLekha-Isolated Dataset for evaluation of our technique which consists of 84 classes (50 Basic, 10 Numerals and 24 Compound Characters). We are able to achieve 96.12% accuracy in just 47 epochs on BanglaLekha-Isolated dataset.

[A New Benchmark on the Recognition of Handwritten Bangla and Farsi Numeral Characters](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.544.9065&rep=rep1&type=pdf): In this work, we applied some advanced character recognition methods to handwritten Bangla and Farsi numeral recognition and evaluated the performance on three public databases: ISI Bangla numerals, CENPARMI Farsi numerals, and IFHCDB Farsi numerals.
3. [Hand Written Bangla Numerals Recognition for Automated Postal System ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325064193_Hand_Written_Bangla_Numerals_Recognition_for_Automated_Postal_System)(the full pdf is available for download): This paper delineate a robust hybrid system for recognition of handwritten Bangla numerals for the automated postal system, which performed feature extraction using k-means clustering, Bayeâ€™s theorem and Maximum a Posteriori, then the recognition is performed using Support Vector Machine . Recognition of handwritten numerals, such as postal codes, reveal all kinds of local and global deformations: distortions, different writing styles, thickness variations, wide variety of scales, limited amount of rotation, added noise, occlusion and missing parts.
4. [An Improved Feature Descriptor for Recognition of Handwritten Bangla Alphabet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05497.pdf): In the present work we have identified a new variation of feature set which significantly outperforms on handwritten Bangla alphabet from the previously used feature set. 132 number of features in all viz. modified shadow features, octant and centroid features, distance based features, quad tree based longest run features are used here. Using this feature set the recognition performance increases sharply from the 75.05% observed in our previous work, to 85.40% on 50 character classes with MLP based classifier on the same dataset. 
5. [Handwritten Bangla Character Recognition Using The State-of-Art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09872.pdf): application of the state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) including VGG Network, All Convolution Network (All-Conv Net), Network in Network (NiN), Residual Network, FractalNet, and DenseNet for HBCR. The deep learning approaches have the advantage of extracting and using feature information, improving the recognition of 2D shapes with a high degree of invariance to translation, scaling and other distortions.
6. [Multi-Column Deep Neural Networks for Offline Handwritten Chinese Character Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0261.pdf): Deep and wide max-pooling convolutional neural networks (MPCNN) on GPU embody the current state of the art in stationary pattern recognition. They outperformed other methods on image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Through output averaging, several independently trained deep NN (DNN) can form a Multi-Column DNN (MCDNN) with error rates 20-40% below those of single DNN.
7. [Multi-column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2745.pdf): Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to achieve near-human performance.
